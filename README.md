# Glean Tennessee

This project was created during Nashville's Civic Day of Hacking to allow farmers and other food providers to notify the [Society of St. Andrew](endhunger.org) of food donations available for harvest and pick up.

This is drawn from the [SoSAGleanTN repo](https://github.com/SoSAGleanTNorg/GleanTnWeb).


The currently deployed firebase app built with jquery is available here: [Donor Connection Firebase App](https://gleantn-1794b.firebaseapp.com)
