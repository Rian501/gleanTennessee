# Glean Tennessee

This project was created during Nashville's Civic Day of Hacking to allow farmers and other food providers to notify the [Society of St. Andrew](endhunger.org) of food donations available for harvest and pick up.

**We are currently working on a migration to React. Tickets listed in the project backlog refer to work to be done on the `feature/react-migrate` branch of the project. Please check out this branch in order to contribute to that feature migration and those tickets.**
